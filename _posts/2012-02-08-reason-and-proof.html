<p>I have always been dissatisified with mathematical proofs, no matter how rigorous they are. I can understand and verify the proofs, but they often teach me very little. My math professors have always felt strange about me, because I ask more questions than they think is necessary.

<p><em>I: "You have proved this theorem, but I still wonder what makes it true."</em>

<p><em>Prof: "I just showed you a proof. You don't understand it?"</em>

<p><em>I: "I understand every step of the proof, but the theorem is true not because you have proved it. I mean, how would somebody come up with the theorem in the first place?"</em>

<p><em>Prof: "Well, I don't know. You need to be extremely smart in order to do that..."</em>


<p>Now I understand that, my objection to proofs is ligitimate. There is a crucial difference between reason and proof. What I want (but often fail to get from classes) is the underlying reason.


<p>The <em>reason</em> that something is true is often deeper and simpler, but harder to find than, a <em>proof</em> that it is true. There can be many proofs of the same truth, but there is often only one reason that <em>makes</em> it true. To put it into analogy: the evidence of a crime doesn't cause the crime to happen. The crime happens because of a much deeper reason, so does the theorem.
